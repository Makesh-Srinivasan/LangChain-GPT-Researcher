## ü§î What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:

- **Open-source libraries**:  Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language-lcel), [components](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts), and [third-party integrations](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/platforms/).
Use [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/#langgraph) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
- **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

### Open-source libraries
- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[`LangGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.

### Productionization:
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

### Deployment:
- **[LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/)**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants.

## üß± What can you build with LangChain?

**‚ùì Question answering with RAG**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/)
- End-to-end Example: [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/chat-langchain)

**üß± Extracting structured output**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/extraction/)
- End-to-end Example: [SQL Llama2 Template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-extract/)

**ü§ñ Chatbots**

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)
- End-to-end Example: [Web LangChain (web researcher chatbot)](https://weblangchain.vercel.app) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/weblangchain)

And much more! Head to the [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/) section of the docs for more.

## üöÄ How does LangChain help?
The main value props of the LangChain libraries are:
1. **Components**: composable building blocks, tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones. 

## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

LCEL is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest ‚Äúprompt + LLM‚Äù chain to the most complex chains.

- **[Overview](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: LCEL and its benefits
- **[Interface](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface)**: The standard Runnable interface for LCEL objects
- **[Primitives](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes
- **[Cheatsheet](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/)**: Quick overview of the most common usage patterns

## Components

Components fall into the following **modules**:

**üìÉ Model I/O**

This includes [prompt management](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates), [prompt optimization](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#example-selectors), a generic interface for [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models) and [LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#llms), and common utilities for working with [model outputs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#output-parsers).

**üìö Retrieval**

Retrieval Augmented Generation involves [loading data](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#document-loaders) from a variety of sources, [preparing it](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#text-splitters), then [searching over (a.k.a. retrieving from)](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#retrievers) it for use in the generation step.

**ü§ñ Agents**

Agents allow an LLM autonomy over how a task is accomplished. Agents make decisions about which Actions to take, then take that Action, observe the result, and repeat until the task is complete. LangChain provides a [standard interface for agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#agents), along with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for building custom agents.
